# STM32L476G-DISCO_Minimal
## Minimal GCC + Makefile based build system for STM32

Minimal setup based on configrations listed below:
- Project generated by STM32CubeMX
- PurpleAlien: [stm32-minimal](https://github.com/PurpleAlien/stm32-minimal)
- TRV's STM32L4 config adapted from PurpleAlien: [minimal-stm32-l4](https://github.com/trv/MT_LEDs/tree/minimal-stm32-l4)

**Huge thanks to these people for showing others the right way to do it**

## Steps to use this build system:
- Clone this repo
- Download STM32CubeL4 from STMicro's github or their downloads page
- Extract the 'Drivers' directory to the root directory of this repo
- Edit the project name in the Makefile
- Add your C, Assembly sources
- Compile!

**This system can easily be adopted for other STM32 boards. To know which flags to use, you can generate a Makefile project from STM32CubeMX.**
